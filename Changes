Revision history for perl module CPAN::Changes

0.500004 - 2024-05-02
  - fix tests on Windows

0.500003 - 2024-02-22
  - fix calling ->name on an unnamed group
  - fix ->set_changes call on groups

0.500002 - 2023-10-26
  - releasing as stable

0.500_001 - 2023-08-27
  - Full rewrite. The new version can parse nested entries to an arbitrary
    depth, rather than just groups. It can parse many more formats, and can
    format the outputs more flexibly. This means it can better handle the
    change logs that actually exist on CPAN.
  - parsed releases keep their original order
  - Pass given ChangeLog filename for --check (Tux)

0.400002 - 2015-06-21
  - revert whitespace changes that were inadvertently included in previous
    release.
  - escape curly brackets in test to avoid warning in perl 5.22

0.400001 - 2015-05-23
  - accept either UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1 files and decode them
  - only treat bracketed text if it is on its own line with no other brackets
  - bump version.pm prereq to make sure it works properly
  - Let long tokens (like URLs) overflow rather than splitting them into
    multiple likes
  - Don't wrap on non-breaking spaces
  - Clean up packaging
  - Return undef for dates or notes that don't exist
  - Quote meta chars to fix a problem that clobbered dates
    with timezones due to the '+' char (GH #20)
